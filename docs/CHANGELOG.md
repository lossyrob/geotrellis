0.10.0
------

The long awaited GeoTrellis 0.10 release is here!

It’s been a while since the 0.9 release of GeoTrellis, and there are many
significant changes and improvements in this release. GeoTrellis has become
an expansive suite of modular components that aide users in the building of
geospatial application in Scala, and as always we’ve focused specifically on
high performance and distributed computing. This is the first official
release that supports working with Apache Spark, and we are very pleased
with the results that have come out of the decision to support Spark as our
main distributed processing engine. Those of you who have been tuned in for
a while know we started with a custom built processing engine based on Akka
actors; this original execution engine still exists in 0.10 but is in a
deprecated state in the geotrellis-engine subproject. Along with upgrading
GeoTrellis to support Spark and handle arbitrarily-sized raster data sets,
we’ve been making improvements and additions to core functionality,
including adding vector and projection support.

It’s been long enough that release notes, stating what has changed since
0.9, would be quite unwieldy. Instead I put together a list of features that
GeoTrellis 0.10 supports. This is included in the README on the GeoTrellis
Github, but I will put them here as well. It is organized by subproject,
with more basic and core subprojects higher in the list, and the subprojects
that rely on that core functionality later in the list, along with a high
level description of each subproject.

**geotrellis-proj4**

- Represent a Coordinate Reference System (CRS) based on Ellipsoid, Datum, and Projection.
- Translate CRSs to and from proj4 string representations.
- Lookup CRS's based on EPSG and other codes.
- Transform `(x, y)` coordinates from one CRS to another.

**geotrellis-vector**

- Provides a scala idiomatic wrapper around JTS types: Point, Line (LineString in JTS), Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLine (MultiLineString in JTS), MultiPolygon, GeometryCollection
- Methods for geometric operations supported in JTS, with results that provide a type-safe way to match over possible results of geometries.
- Provides a Feature type that is the composition of a geometry and a generic data type.
- Read and write geometries and features to and from GeoJSON.
- Read and write geometries to and from WKT and WKB.
- Reproject geometries between two CRSs.
- Geometric operations: Convex Hull, Densification, Simplification
- Perform Kriging interpolation on point values.
- Perform affine transformations of geometries

**geotrellis-vector-testkit**

- GeometryBuilder for building test geometries
- GeometryMatcher for scalatest unit tests, which aides in testing equality in geometries with an optional threshold.

**geotrellis-raster**

- Provides types to represent single- and multi-band rasters, supporting Bit, Byte, UByte, Short, UShort, Int, Float, and Double data, with either a constant NoData value (which improves performance) or a user defined NoData value.
- Treat a tile as a collection of values, by calling "map" and "foreach", along with floating point valued versions of those methods (separated out for performance).
- Combine raster data in generic ways.
- Render rasters via color ramps and color maps to PNG and JPG images.
- Read GeoTiffs with DEFLATE, LZW, and PackBits compression, including horizontal and floating point prediction for LZW and DEFLATE.
- Write GeoTiffs with DEFLATE or no compression.
- Reproject rasters from one CRS to another.
- Resample of raster data.
- Mask and Crop rasters.
- Split rasters into smaller tiles, and stitch tiles into larger rasters.
- Derive histograms from rasters in order to represent the distribution of values and create quantile breaks.
- Local Map Algebra operations: Abs, Acos, Add, And, Asin, Atan, Atan2, Ceil, Cos, Cosh, Defined, Divide, Equal, Floor, Greater, GreaterOrEqual, InverseMask, Less, LessOrEqual, Log, Majority, Mask, Max, MaxN, Mean, Min, MinN, Minority, Multiply, Negate, Not, Or, Pow, Round, Sin, Sinh, Sqrt, Subtract, Tan, Tanh, Undefined, Unequal, Variance, Variety, Xor, If

- Generic architecture for saving/loading layers RDD data and metadata to/from various backends, using Spark's IO API with Space Filling Curve indexing to optimize storage retrieval (support for Hilbert curve and Z order curve SFCs). HDFS and local file system are supported backends by default, S3 and Accumulo are supported backends by the `geotrellis-s3` and `geotrellis-accumulo` projects, respectively.
- Query architecture that allows for simple querying of layer data by spatial or spatiotemporal bounds.
- Perform map algebra operations on layers of raster data, including all supported Map Algebra operations mentioned in the geotrellis-raster feature list.
