/**
  * Calculates the slope of each cell in a raster.
  *
  * Slope is the magnitude portion of the gradient vector. It is the maximum
  * change of elevation from a raster cell to any immediate neighbor. It uses Horn's method
  * for computing slope.
  *
  * As with aspect, slope is calculated from estimates of the partial derivatives dz / dx and dz / dy.
  *
  * Slope is computed in degrees from horizontal.
  *
  * The use of a z-factor is essential for correct slope calculations when the surface z units are expressed in units different from the ground x,y units.
  *
  * If Slope operations encounters NoData in its neighborhood, that neighborhood cell well be treated as having
  * the same elevation as the focal cell.
  *
  * The expression for slope is:
  * {{{
  * val slope = atan(sqrt(pow(`dz / dy`, 2) * pow(`dz / dx`, 2)))
  * }}}
  *
