*GeoTrellis* is a Scala library and framework that uses
Spark to work with raster data.  It is released under
the Apache 2 License.

GeoTrellis reads, writes, and operates on raster data
as fast as possible. It implements many
[Map Algebra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_algebra)
operations as well as vector to raster or raster to
vector operations.

GeoTrellis also provides tools to render rasters into
PNGs or to store metadata about raster files as JSON.
It aims to provide raster processing at web speeds (sub-second
or less) with RESTful endpoints as well as provide
fast batch processing of large raster data sets.

Please visit the **[project site](http://geotrellis.io)**
for more information as well as some interactive demos.

## GeoTrellis Features

This is a list of features contained in the GeoTrellis library. It is broken up by the subproject that contains the features.

- Represent a Coordinate Reference System (CRS) based on Ellipsoid, Datum, and Projection.
- Translate CRSs to and from proj4 string representations.
- Lookup CRS's based on EPSG and other codes.
- Transform `(x, y)` coordinates from one CRS to another.

#### geotrellis-vector

- Provides a scala idiomatic wrapper around JTS types: Point, Line (LineString in JTS), Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLine (MultiLineString in JTS), MultiPolygon, GeometryCollection
- Methods for geometric operations supported in JTS, with results that provide a type-safe way to match over possible results of geometries.
- Provides a Feature type that is the composition of a geometry and a generic data type.
- Read and write geometries and features to and from GeoJSON.
- Read and write geometries to and from WKT and WKB.
- Reproject geometries between two CRSs.
- Geometric operations: Convex Hull, Densification, Simplification
- Perform Kriging interpolation on point values.
- Perform affine transformations of geometries

#### geotrellis-vector-testkit

- GeometryBuilder for building test geometries
- GeometryMatcher for scalatest unit tests, which aides in testing equality in geometries with an optional threshold.

#### geotrellis-raster

- Provides types to represent single- and multi-band rasters, supporting Bit, Byte, UByte, Short, UShort, Int, Float, and Double data, with either a constant NoData value (which improves performance) or a user defined NoData value.
- Treat a tile as a collection of values, by calling "map" and "foreach", along with floating point valued versions of those methods (separated out for performance).
- Combine raster data in generic ways.
- Render rasters via color ramps and color maps to PNG and JPG images.
- Read GeoTiffs with DEFLATE, LZW, and PackBits compression, including horizontal and floating point prediction for LZW and DEFLATE.

- Reproject rasters from one CRS to another.
- Resample of raster data.
- Mask and Crop rasters.
- Split rasters into smaller tiles, and stitch tiles into larger rasters.

- Generic architecture for saving/loading layers RDD data and metadata to/from various backends, using Spark's IO API with Space Filling Curve indexing to optimize storage retrieval (support for Hilbert curve and Z order curve SFCs). HDFS and local file system are supported backends by default, S3 and Accumulo are supported backends by the `geotrellis-s3` and `geotrellis-accumulo` projects, respectively.
- Query architecture that allows for simple querying of layer data by spatial or spatiotemporal bounds.
- Perform map algebra operations on layers of raster data, including all supported Map Algebra operations mentioned in the geotrellis-raster feature list.
